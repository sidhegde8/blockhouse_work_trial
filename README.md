Order Book Reconstruction from MBO to MBP-10
============================================

Overview:
---------
This program reconstructs a Market By Price (MBP) Level-10 order book from Market By Order (MBO) events. It parses timestamped updates (new, modify, cancel), updates internal bid/ask books accordingly, and outputs the top 10 price levels for each side at every event.

The final output is a CSV named `output.csv` that mimics the structure of `mbp.csv`.

Usage:
------
To build:
```sh
    make
```
To run:
```sh
    ./reconstruction.exe mbo.csv
```

To run unit tests:
```sh
    make test
```

To clean up:
```sh
    make clean
```

Optimization and Performance Considerations:
--------------------------------------------
1. **Efficient Price-Level Tracking**:
   - Used `std::map<double, std::set<long>>` for both `bids` and `asks`.
   - Bid map is sorted in **descending** order (`std::greater<double>`) to prioritize higher prices.
   - Ask map uses default ascending order to prioritize lower prices.
   - This enables O(log N) insertions, deletions, and fast access to top levels.

2. **Fast Order Lookup**:
   - Maintained an `order_id â†’ (side, price, size)` hash table for O(1) retrieval during cancellations and modifications.
   - This avoids scanning the entire book during each event.

3. **Minimized Redundant Work**:
   - Only emitted top 10 levels at each update to avoid unnecessary formatting or extra copying.
   - Cached and reused stringstream buffers where applicable.

4. **Avoided Overhead from Unnecessary Copies**:
   - Passed large structures (like vectors or strings) by reference where possible.
   - Used `emplace` over `insert` to avoid temporary construction.

5. **Clean Separation of Logic**:
   - Parsing, order handling, and output logic are modular.
   - Unit tests target the `OrderBook` class in isolation.

6. **I/O Throughput Considerations**:
   - Used buffered output (via `std::ofstream`) to minimize I/O overhead.
   - Ensured consistent fixed-point precision for price formatting (to match `mbp.csv`).
